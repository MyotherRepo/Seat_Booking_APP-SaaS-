#  Hybrid Workplace Seat Booking System

A flexible **seat reservation and attendance system** for hybrid workplaces â€” built with **Django** (REST API backend) and **React** (frontend). Supports real-time seat booking, waitlisting, attendance marking, analytics, and multi-org (SaaS) architecture.

## Assumptions

-  Employees must book seats before visiting the office.
-  Floor plans and seat locations are pre-defined by **management**.
-  Employees can **view availability** on a given date via a floor plan UI.
-  Users must **mark attendance** on arrival â€” unmarked seats by 10:00 AM are freed.
-  Cancelled or no-show seats are **auto-assigned to waitlisted users**.
-  Multiple organizations can use the platform, each operating in its own namespace.
